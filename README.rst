A custom Twilio `SendGrid`_ Email Sender plugin for the Curity Identity Server.

Building the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can build the plugin by issuing the command ``mvn package``. This will produce a JAR file along with the needed dependencies in the ``target`` directory,
which can be installed.

Installing the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the plugin, copy the compiled JAR (and all of its dependencies) into the :file:`${IDSVR_HOME}/usr/share/plugins/${pluginGroup}`
on each node, including the admin node. For more information about installing plugins, refer to `curity.io/plugins`_.

Required Dependencies
"""""""""""""""""""""

For a list of the dependencies and their versions, run ``mvn dependency:list``. Ensure that all of these are installed in
the plugin group; otherwise, they will not be accessible to this plug-in and run-time errors will result.

Configuration
"""""""""""""
The plugin only takes two configuration parameters:

- Default Sender - A SendGrid registered email address that is allowed to send emails.
- Send Grid API Key - A SendGrid API key for the plugin to authenticate against the SendGrid API.

Sendgrid Templating
"""""""""""""
To activate Sendgrid Templated, override the desired email *.txt.vm template as documented in Curity and add at least one mandatory parameter:
``sendgridTemplateId=1234abc``
You can have as many additional parameters as well, which will be passed as sendgrid parameters to the template and substituted in the template.

The file must be in *.properties format:
``
sendgridTemplateId=1234abc
key=value
key2=value
...
keyN=valueN
``
